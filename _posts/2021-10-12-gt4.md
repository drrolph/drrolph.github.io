A very successful GT4 test, with over 400km completed.
Fastest GT4 Driver

Competitive performance relative to the reference driver, Jim Pla, winner of the GT World Challenge Barcelona race, just days before.

Strong foundation, with further testing planned to build on this experience base.
Race ready for 2022.
